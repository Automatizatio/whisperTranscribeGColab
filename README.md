Google colab for transcribing under 25 min mp3 monologues/lectures using OpenAI Whisper

1) Acquire desire MP3 file. It should be a monologue or lecture, and under 25 mins long. You can use other forms of media or longer length, but you risk hard to deciper transcription and VRAM issues on Google Colab.
2) Open the notebook
3) Upload your MP3 to the session storage. It should look like below and be in the content folder.

4) Go through each cell and wait for each to finish.
5) At the end, you should see a file with your transcription at the session storage. The name will be "transcription.txt". It will be in the same location as your mp3 file.
